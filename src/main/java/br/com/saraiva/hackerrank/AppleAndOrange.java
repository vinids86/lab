 *
 * Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In
 * the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where is the start point, and is
 * the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its
 * right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is
 * at point , and the orange tree is at point .
 *
 * Apple and orange(2).png
 *
 * When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands units of distance from its tree of origin
 * along the -axis. A negative value of means the fruit fell units to the tree's left, and
 * a positive value of means it falls units to the tree's right.
 *
 * Given the value of for apples and oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will
 * fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range )?
 *
 * For example, Sam's house is between and . The apple tree is located at and the orange
 * at . There are apples and oranges. Apples are thrown units distance from , and units
 * distance. Adding each apple distance to the position of the tree, they land at .
 * Oranges land at . One apple and two oranges land in the inclusive range so we print
 *
 * 1 2 Function Description
 *
 * Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below. It should print the
 * number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.
 *
 * countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):
 *
 * s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location. t: integer, ending location of
 * Sam's house location. a: integer, location of the Apple tree. b: integer, location of
 * the Orange tree. apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the
 * tree. oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree. Input
 * Format
 *
 * The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of
 * and . The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective
 * values of and . The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the
 * respective values of and . The fourth line contains space-separated integers denoting
 * the respective distances that each apple falls from point . The fifth line contains
 * space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from
 * point .
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print two integers on two different lines:
 *
 * The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house. The second integer:
 * the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house. Sample Input 0
 *
 * 7 11 5 15 3 2 -2 2 1 5 -6 Sample Output 0
 *
 * 1 1 Explanation 0
 *
 * The first apple falls at position . The second apple falls at position . The third
 * apple falls at position . The first orange falls at position . The second orange falls
 * at position . Only one fruit (the second apple) falls within the region between and ,
 * so we print as our first line of output. Only the second orange falls within the region
 * between and , so we print as our second line of output.
